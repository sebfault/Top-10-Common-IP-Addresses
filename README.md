Top-10-Common-IP-Addresses
==========================
  Determine the top 10 most common source IP addresses, and their hit rates, for a fleet of 1000 web servers within the     last hour.
  
  The following assumptions may be used...
  * web servers are locally writing access logs in the Apache Combined Log Format           (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/logs.html#combined).
  * web servers are accessible by ssh.

Solution uses a combination of python and linux commands.
